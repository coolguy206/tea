  <h2>WHY TEA?</h2>
  <p>Tea is something we all have in common. It’s a <br class="desktop">drink shared in nearly every culture around the world. <br class="desktop">Over a cup of tea, people can find moments of<br class="desktop"> connection, understanding, and
    inspiration. That’s <br class="desktop">why we call ourselves Tea
    Collection.</p>

  <h2>THE TEA STORY</h2>
  <p>At Tea Collection, we travel the world twice a year bringing the beauty of <br class="desktop">international cultures and modern design to children's clothing. We create globally<br class="desktop"> inspired, well-made, beautiful kids clothes
    for all of life's adventures, big
    and small.</p>

  <p>We inspire global connection and curiosity for little citizens of the world helping <br class="desktop">them discover that no matter where we live or what language we speak, there is so<br class="desktop"> much we all have in common.</p>

  <p>As we travel, both around the world and across the street, we keep our eyes—and <br class="desktop">our hearts—wide open. We know there’s more to every culture than beloved landmarks<br class="desktop"> and beautiful handicrafts. There’s also a
    need and a vulnerability. So
    wherever we <br class="desktop">are, we strive to be mindful and responsible, giving back 10% of our profits to ensure <br class="desktop">a better world for kids everywhere</p>

  <h2>WE GIVE BACK</h2>
  <p>Since 2003, we’ve partnered with the Global Fund for Children, a nonprofit<br class="desktop"> dedicated to supporting grassroots organizations worldwide.</p>
  <p>We’re proud to say, we’ve donated over $500k so far helping advance the<br class="desktop"> dignity of children around the world.</p>

  <h2>LITTLE SISTERS FUND</h2>
  <p>In addition to partnering with the Global Fund for Children, we’re committed <br class="desktop">to finding other opportunities to give back when we travel for our seasonal<br class="desktop"> inspiration. That’s why most recently, we’ve
    partnered with the Little Sisters<br class="desktop">
    Fund, an organization in Nepal dedicated to empowering young girls.</p>
