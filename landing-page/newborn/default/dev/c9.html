      <h2>globally inspired</h2>
      <p>
        Tea began with the dream to inspire global<br> connection and curiosity for children. We<br> travel the world bringing the beauty of<br> different cultures and modern design to<br> clothing for babies, toddlers, and kids.

      <h2>heirloom quality</h2>
      <p>
        Our clothes are responsibly made and<br> designed to last so you’ll be able to pass your<br> Tea down from kid to kid. We stand by our<br> quality and have created a secondhand<br> marketplace called REWEAR, where you can<br> buy, sell, or
        trade-in preloved Tea.
