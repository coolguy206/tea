  <p>For your protection, we recommend you return all items via a traceable carrier such as USPS, UPS or FedEx. Tea is not responsible for packages not received if a tracking number is not provided. Returns and exchanges must be returned prepaid; we
    cannot accept C.O.D. deliveries.</p>

  <p>Please allow 2-3 weeks for us to process your gift return. Once we've received your return and everything is good to go, you'll receive an email from us with your teacollection.com store credit in the amount of the original gift, as well as a
    free shipping code that expires in two weeks. At that time, you may place your replacement order on teacollection.com or save the store credit for a later date. Currently, we cannot accept returns for items purchased from a retailer other than
    teacollection.com.</p>

  <p>If you would like help with an exchange, return, or new purchase, please call us at 866.374.8747 or email us at <a href="mailto:service@teacollection.com">service@teacollection.com</a>.</p>
