  <!--<h3>Frequently asked questions about returns/exchanges:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Do I have to pay to send items back for a return/exchange?</h4>
      Yes, you are responsible for the cost of the return. If you use our SmartLabel return method, $7 will be deducted from your store credit. You can always send the package back on your own using UPS, USPS or FedEx (we recommend you use tracking
      or delivery confirmation when you return on your own, just to be safe).<br><br>While you do pay to send returns back to Tea, you will receive free shipping on your exchange/new order.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <h4>Can I return individual items from a Set?</h4>
      No, we're sorry, but to return a piece from a set, the entire set must be returned.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <h4>How long will it take to process my refund?</h4>
      It will take approximately 2 - 3 weeks to process your refund once we receive your return.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <h4>How do I process an exchange?</h4>
      Use our online return web form <a href="http://www.teacollection.com/static/returns-purchased.html">here</a> and select the exchange option. When you receive your return confirmation email with your personalized free shipping code you can
      order your replacement items online. We'll bill your credit card for the new merchandise and refund your original form of payment as soon as we receive your returned items minus the cost of SmartLabel (should you choose that option).
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <h4>How do gift returns work?</h4>
      If you're returning something you received as a gift, <a href="http://www.teacollection.com/static/returns-gifts.html">click here</a>. It will take you to a page with all the info you'll need and a link to a downloadable form. You'll need to
      print out that form, fill it out and send it back to us with your items. We recommend you use a traceable method with UPS, USPS or FedEx, just to be safe.<br><br>
      Please allow 2-3 weeks for us to process your gift return. Once everything has been received, a store credit in the amount that was originally paid as well as free shipping code will be emailed to you. At that time, you may place your
      replacement order on teacollection.com or save the store credit for a later date. Currently, we cannot accept returns for items purchased from a retailer other than teacollection.com.
