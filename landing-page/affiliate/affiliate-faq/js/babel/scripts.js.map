When your visitors click through to the Tea Collection website via these links, that visitor is tracked until they place an order. When an order is placed by such a visitor, the order is associated with your website as the referring source and your ShareASale affiliate account is credited 8% of the entire order. At the end of each month, ShareASale sends you a check for the entire amount of revenue share you have earned in the previous month once you have reached a $50 threshold. Thus, the more visitors you refer to Tea Collection and the more of those visitors who turn into customers of Tea Collection, the more you get paid--and unlike many other websites, you get paid each time that customer places an order within 90 days, not just the first time!'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        q: 'Who can become a Tea Collection affiliate?',\r\n        a: 'Any website operator that operates a family friendly website is eligible to join the Tea Collection Affiliate Program, subject to the program\\'s <a href=\"/affiliate/affiliate-program/terms-condition\">terms and conditions</a>.'\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        q: 'Can websites outside of the U.S. become affiliate partners?',\r\n        a: 'Yes, but please be aware that we currently ship UPS to the 50 U.S. states.
