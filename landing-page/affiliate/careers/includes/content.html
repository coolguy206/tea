	<h2>Our Story </h2>
	<p>
		Tea began with the dream to inspire global connection and curiosity for little citizens of the world. We believe that no matter where we live or what language we speak, there is so much we all have in common. We travel the world bringing the beauty of different cultures and modern design to children's clothing. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We design globally-inspired, timeless styles for all of life’s special moments and adventures, both big and small. We believe in making high-quality, long-lasting clothing that can be passed from kid to kid (and stays out of landfills). And since our founding, we’ve been committed to making the world a better place for kids everywhere. We dedicate 10% of profits to support philanthropic efforts worldwide. 
	</p>

	<h2>Our Team </h2>
	<p>
		At Tea, our employees embody our brand spirit. We’re curious about the world. We seek to explore different destinations and create meaningful connections with the people we meet. We are collaborative, creative, and kind.
	</p>

	<p>
		While we come from different cultural, educational and professional backgrounds, we share a common set of values. We trust and support each other as one team. We lead with head, heart and bold ambition. We are open-minded, adaptable, and focused on exceeding our own expectations.
	</p>

	<p>
		At its heart, Tea is about fostering a sense of curiosity and connection, and exploring the world in a very personal way. To help our employees make that dream a reality, we make a yearly contribution to each employee for international travel and offer a generous time off policy to ensure employees can explore, connect and recharge. Collectively, we’ve traveled to more than 40 countries - and counting.
