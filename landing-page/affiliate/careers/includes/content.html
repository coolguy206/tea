	<h1>Careers</h1>

	<h2>Our Story </h2>
	<p>
		Tea began with the dream to inspire global connection and curiosity for little citizens of the world. We believe
		that no matter where we live or what language we speak, there is so much we all have in common. We travel the
		world bringing the beauty of different cultures and modern design to children's clothing.
	</p>

	<p>
		We design globally-inspired, timeless styles for all of life’s special moments and adventures, both big and
		small. We believe in making high-quality, long-lasting clothing that can be passed from kid to kid (and stays
		out of landfills). And since our founding, we’ve been committed to making the world a better place for kids
		everywhere. We dedicate 10% of profits to support philanthropic efforts worldwide.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Team </h2>
	<p>
		At Tea, our employees embody our brand spirit. We’re curious about the world. We seek to explore different
		destinations and create meaningful connections with the people we meet. We are collaborative, creative, and
		kind.
	</p>

	<p>
		While we come from different cultural, educational and professional backgrounds, we share a common set of
		values. We trust and support each other as one team. We lead with head, heart and bold ambition. We are
		open-minded, adaptable, and focused on exceeding our own expectations.
	</p>

	<p>
		At its heart, Tea is about fostering a sense of curiosity and connection, and exploring the world in a very
		personal way. To help our employees make that dream a reality, we make a yearly contribution to each employee
		for international travel and offer a generous time off policy to ensure employees can explore, connect and
		recharge. Collectively, we’ve traveled to more than 40 countries - and counting.
	</p>
