    give you credit for the sales you refer. Follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to “LINKS” in the top navigation menu and select “Get a Link/Banner” from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Find Tea Collection and click “Get Links” next to our company name. You can browse through the different text
      and banner links available.
      <ul>
        <li>Click “Get HTML Code”. From here you can copy the HMTL code or “select URL only” for your custom code/link.
        </li>
      </ul>
