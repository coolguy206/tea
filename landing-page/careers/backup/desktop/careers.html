		<h2>Very Tea</h2>
		<p>Sometimes someone at Tea will receive a compliment of being "very Tea." It has nothing to do with education or references, it means that someone embodies our brand spirit. They dive in with all their senses turned on, with warmth and curiosity. They have an innate desire to explore, to connect and share with others, and to find beauty wherever we go.</p>
		
		<p>While everyone here is "very Tea," we definitely don't come from the same backgrounds. We have designers, accountants, MBAs, buyers, salespeople and new college graduates. We have people from Venezuela, Spain, China, the UK and all around the US. We have degrees in economics, photography, business, design, merchandising, art history and political science. And we have collectively visited more than 40 countries.</p>

		<p>Tea is at its heart about going into and being in the world, in a very personal way. To help everyone at Tea go there, we make a yearly contribution to each employee for international travel and exploration. Upon their return, our Tea travelers write blog posts to share their adventures with all of us (and the world).</p>
