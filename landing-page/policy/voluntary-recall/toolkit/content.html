  <h1>VOLUNTARY RECALL NOTICE:</h1>

  <h2>Tea Collection Recalls Children's One Piece Romper Due to Choking Hazard</h2>

  <p>We have made a promise at Tea Collection to create well-made, beautiful products for all life's adventures. During the design and manufacturing phases of our clothing collection, safety and quality are top priorities. All of the products we
    sell have passed (and continue to pass) safety and quality standards.</p>

  <p>However, every once in a while, something unexpected happens. We recently became aware of a safety problem with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Vermillion Painted Floral Romper (style #7F32500)</li>
    <li>Shocking Fuchsia Rose Romper (style #7F32504)</li>
    <li>when customers contacted us to advise that some of the snaps had come loose. There have been five incidents of the snaps detaching but no one has been injured with this product and we are concerned about the loose snaps becoming a chocking
      hazard, so we are issuing a voluntarily recall of these rompers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We have an uncompromising commitment to the quality and the safety of our products. Please return your product and we would be happy to issue you a full refund of the purchase price of the items listed above.</p>
