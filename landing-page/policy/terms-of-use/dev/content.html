  <h2>Mobile Terms of Service</h2>

  <h2>Tea Collection </h2>

  <p>Last updated: February 14, 2023</p>

  <p>The Tea Collection mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by Tea Collection (“Tea Collection”, “we”, or
    “us”). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may
    modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we
    may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of
    any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.
    By consenting to Tea Collection’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text messages from
    and on behalf of Tea Collection through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your
    mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic
    telephone dialing system or other technology. Service-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information
    (e.g., order updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other
    marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).
    You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is
    not a condition of any purchase with Tea Collection. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary.
    We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging
    imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile
    plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text
    messages, including charges from your wireless provider.
    You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to +18447121502 or click the
    unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation
    text message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have
    subscribed to other Tea Collection mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires
    otherwise, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their
    respective mobile terms.
    For Service support or assistance, text HELP to +18447121502 or email <a
      href="mailto:service@teacollection.com">service@teacollection.com</a>.
    We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify you of
    these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or
    telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in
    such messages.
  </p>

  <p>The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to
    provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program with
    your new number.
    To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected
    delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or
    may not take in reliance on the information or Service.
    We respect your right to privacy. To see how we collect and use your personal information, please see our <a
      href="/policy/privacy-policy">Privacy Notice</a>.
