You may exercise your right to know twice in any 12-month period.

Similarly, the CCPA prohibits businesses from selling or sharing the personal information of consumers it actually knows are under 16 years old without first obtaining consent from consumers who are between 13 and 15 years old or the consumer’s parent or guardian for consumers under age 13 (the “right to opt-in”). </p><p>We cannot sell or share your personal information after we receive your request to opt-out unless you later consent to the selling or sharing of your personal information. </p><p>When a business uses automated decision-making technology (“ADMT”) to make significant decisions about you, you may have rights to:</p><ul><li>Obtain certain information about how the business uses ADMT, that is specific to you.</li><li>Opt-out of the ADMT use unless the business provides you with a method to appeal the decision to a human reviewer with the authority to overturn the decision or another exception applies.</li></ul><p>We do not currently use ADMT to make significant decisions about consumers, so we do not provide ADMT access, opt-out, or appeal rights.</p><p>You have the right not to be discriminated or retaliated against for exercising any of your privacy rights under the CCPA.</p><p>Subject to certain limitations under California’s Shine the Light law, California residents may contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy to request a list of third parties to whom we disclosed certain personal information for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding year. The information we will provide will describe our general practices in the prior calendar year and will not be specific to you. </p><p>Your request should indicate that you are a California resident, and you must provide your full current California address, where we will send our response. Your inquiry must specify “Shine the Light Request” in the subject line of the email or the first line of the letter, and include your California address. We are only required to respond to one such request per individual each year.  We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.</p><h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3><p>To exercise the right to know (including data portability), delete, or correct described above, please submit a verifiable request to us to <a href="mailto:service@teacollection.com">service@teacollection.com</a>.</p><p>Please describe your request with sufficient detail so we can properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

Please note that we will only be able to provide specific information to those users that we can validate the information provided against what we have on file.</p><p>You can also submit your request to opt-out of personal information sales and sharing through an opt-out preference signal. </p><p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know, delete, or correct related to your personal information. We may request specific information from you or your authorized representative to confirm your or their identity before we can process your right to know, delete, or correct your personal information. </p><p>We cannot respond to your request to know, delete, or correct if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relating to you. </p><p>For requests to limit or opt-out, we ask for the information necessary to complete the request, which may include, for example, the consumer’s name, email address, or account username.</p><p>We will confirm receipt of your request within ten business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the ten-day timeframe, please contact <a href="mailto:service@teacollection.com">service@teacollection.com</a>.</p><p>We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable request within 45 days of its receipt.

If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. </p><p>In response to your request to limit or opt-out, we will process your request, as soon as feasible. We will only use personal information provided from your request to comply with the request.</p><p>We may deny opt-out requests if we have a good-faith belief that the request is fraudulent and will clearly explain our denial decision to the requestor.</p><p>Once you make a request to limit or opt-out, we will wait at least 12 months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales or sharing. </p><p>The CCPA prohibits a third party from reselling or resharing personal information unless you have received explicit notice and an opportunity to opt-out of further sales or sharing. </p><h3>How We Protect Your Personal Data</h3><p>We use commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to protect your personal data from accidental loss or destruction and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.
