  <p>Tea Collection makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information collected from you is protected against loss and unauthorized access. This protection applies in relation to information stored in both electronic and hard
    copy form. Tea Collection uses industry standard security techniques on our websites to help protect against the loss, misuse or modification of information that you have provided. When you access your personal information or transmit personally
    identifiable data to us, that information is stored on servers that we have used commercially reasonable efforts to protect from unauthorized access or intrusion. While we implement the above security measures, you should be aware that 100%
    security is not possible.</p>

    calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and
    addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2005 will receive information regarding 2004 sharing activities).</p>
  <p>To obtain this information, please send an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:service@teacollection.com">service@teacollection.com</a> with "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will
