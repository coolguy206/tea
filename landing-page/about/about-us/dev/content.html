    <h2>THE STORY OF TEA</h2>
    <p> Tea began with the dream to inspire global connection and curiosity for little citizens of the world. We believe that no matter where we live or what language we speak, there is so much we all have in common. We the travel world bringing the
      beauty of different cultures and modern design to children's clothing.</p>

    <h2>WHY TEA?</h2>
    <p>Tea is something we all have in common. It’s a drink shared in nearly every culture around the world. Over a cup of tea, people can find moments of connection, understanding, and inspiration. That’s why we call ourselves Tea Collection.</p>

    <h2>WE GIVE BACK</h2>
    <p>As we travel we keep our eyes—and our hearts—wide open. We know there’s more to every culture than beloved landmarks and beautiful handicrafts. There’s also a need and a vulnerability. So wherever we are, we strive to be mindful and
      responsible, giving back 10% of our profits to ensure a better world for kids everywhere. Since 2003, we’ve partnered with the Global Fund for Children, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting grassroots organizations worldwide.</p>
    <p>We’re proud to say, we’ve donated over $500,000 so far helping advance the dignity of children around the world.</p>

    <h2>LITTLE SISTERS FUND</h2>
    <p>In addition to partnering with the Global Fund for Children, we’re committed to finding other opportunities to give back when we travel for our seasonal inspiration. That’s why most recently, we’ve partnered with the Little Sisters Fund, an
      organization in Nepal dedicated to empowering young girls.</p>
