    <main>
        <p>
            Respect for all people in all cultures is a cornerstone of our company, whether weâ€™re traveling the world in
            search of inspiration for our clothing collection or hiring a manufacturing partner to actually make the
            clothes in that collection.
        </p>

        <p>
            We follow ethical sourcing practices so we can all feel good about our global impact. We are mindful of our
            presence in the world and our responsibility to those around us.
        </p>

        <p>
            While we can't be in every factory all the time, we are incredibly diligent to ensure that our partners
            around the globe follow the highest possible standards. We have no tolerance for anything unlawful or even
            slightly questionable.
        </p>
