				q: 'Does Tea clothing tend to run large or small?',
				a: '<p>Tea clothes run true to size, though every child is different. We’ve found our <a href="/help/size-chart">size chart</a> is a great way to estimate what size to order.</p>',
				section: 'general'
			},
			{
				q: 'What’s the best way to wash Tea clothing?',
				a: '<p>We always recommend following the washing instructions on the label of the Tea garment. Many of our clothes are 100% cotton, which we suggest washing in cold water with a low tumble dry setting. All of our clothes are pre-washed and pre-shrunk.</p><p><b>Please note:</b>We advise against using any detergents or stain removers that contain Oxiclean. The active agent in Oxiclean (Sodium Percarbonate) interacts with textiles, acting like a bleaching agent by removing dye. Time, sun exposure and heat will further exacerbate the bleaching effect.</p>',
				section: 'general'
			},
			{
				q: 'Do you ship internationally?',
				a: '<p>Yes! Please see our <a href="/order/shipping-info" target="_blank">shipping page</a> for more information on international shipments. Tea also offers standard shipping to the 50 US States and territories, and we ship our own products (but not 3rd party brands) to Canada. Here is a list of <a href="/shop-locations" target="_blank">stores</a> in a few other countries.</p>',

				q: 'How are duties and taxes collected?',
				a: '<p>Items shipped to Canada are subject to import custom duties and taxes (“import fees”). The recipient of the shipment is the importer of record and is responsible for import fees assessed.</p><p>Items shipped via standard shipping (Canada Post) enter Canada through CBSA screening centers, are inspected by CBSA Officers and assessed for applicable customs duties, taxes and charges. If duties and/or taxes are owed, items will be delivered along with the E14 Customs Invoice indicating the amount that the addressee must pay before the package can be released to them. Canada Post collects the fees on behalf of the CBSA and accepts the following methods of payment:</p><ul><li>Cash</li><li>Certified Check or Uncertified Business Check</li><li>Credit Card (Visa, MasterCard or American Express)</li><li>Commercial Account</li></ul><p>Items shipped via FedEx follow the same screening process as items shipped via standard shipping. Once FedEx takes possession of the order, the customer is contacted via phone with the total cost of duties and taxes. Fees can be paid over the phone or directly to the FedEx delivery driver via the following methods:</p><ul><li>Cash</li><li>Personal Check</li><li>Credit Card (Visa, MasterCard or American Express)</li></ul><p>Items shipped via either method to very remote locations may be delivered by a third party agent designated by the shipper and are subject to other duty and tax collection methods/standards.

			{
				q: 'How are duties and taxes calculated?',
				a: '<p>Duty rates are determined by the classification of a good, which varies by country of origin and country of destination. Tax rates are driven by the classification of a good and the tax laws of the destination province. Taxes typically range between 15-20% of the order total, but may vary. One resource for estimating duties and taxes can be found below:</p><p><a href="https://www.crossbordershopping.ca/calculators/canadian-duty-calculator" target="_blank">https://www.crossbordershopping.ca/calculators/canadian-duty-calculator</a></p><p>Please note this site is not affiliated with Tea Collection and is only provided for reference</p>',
				section: 'ca-policies'
			},
			{
				q: 'Are there duty and tax exemptions?',
				a: '<p>Orders with item prices totaling $20 CAD or less are duty- and tax-free. This means that you will not be charged duties and taxes via the shipper if the total is $20 CAD or less. Select items are tax-exempt in specific provinces. If your item is tax exempt, you will not be required to pay duties and taxes to the shipper.</p>',
				section: 'ca-policies'
			},
			{
				q: 'Is every item eligible for Canadian shipping?',
				a: '<p>At this time, we are only able to ship products actually manufactured by Tea Collection to Canada. We are not able to ship 3rd party branded items across the border. There are also a few long sleeve layette (newborn) styles that do not meet Canadian standards regarding fit at this time. These styles are flagged on the site as “not shippable to Canada.”</p><p>Items that cannot be shipped to Canada will be removed from your shopping cart when you select a Canadian ship-to address, and you will not be charged for these items.</p>',
