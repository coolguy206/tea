    <div class="text">
        <div class="chest">
            <h2>Chest</h2>
            <p>Wrap a measuring tape under your child's armpits, making sure it passes across the fullest part of his
                chest and around his shoulder blades. His arms should be relaxed naturally against his sides. (Good
                luck! You're going to have to be superhero-fast!)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hips">
            <h2>Hips</h2>
            <p>Have your child stand with his legs together, and wrap the measuring tape in a loop around the widest
                part of his hips. (If he's not standing yet, have him lie down. You might need a partner to keep him
                distracted—and still—for a minute!)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="waist">
            <h2>Natural Waist</h2>
            <p>Tie a string around your child's middle and help him bend from side to side. The string will settle
                around his natural waist, above his hipbones. Wrap a measuring tape around this part of his waist.</p>
