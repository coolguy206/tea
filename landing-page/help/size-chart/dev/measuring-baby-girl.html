    <div class="text">
        <div class="chest">
            <h2>Chest</h2>
            <p>Wrap a measuring tape under your child's armpits, making sure it passes across the fullest part of her
                chest and around her shoulder blades. Her arms should be relaxed naturally against her sides. (Good
                luck! You're going to have to be superhero-fast!)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hips">
            <h2>Hips</h2>
            <p>Have your child stand with her legs together, and wrap the measuring tape in a loop around the widest
                part of her hips. (If she's not standing yet, have her lie down. You might need a partner to keep her
                distracted—and still—for a minute!)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="waist">
            <h2>Natural Waist</h2>
            <p>Tie a string around your child's middle and help her bend from side to side. The string will settle
                around her natural waist, above her hipbones. Wrap a measuring tape around this part of her waist.</p>
