    <div class="text">
        <div class="chest">
            <h2>Chest</h2>
            <p>Wrap a measuring tape under your child's armpits, making sure it passes across the fullest part of her
                chest and around her shoulder blades. Her arms should be relaxed naturally against her sides.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hips">
            <h2>Hips</h2>
            <p>Have your child stand with her legs together, not spread apart. Wrap the measuring tape in a loop
                around
                the widest part of her hips.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="waist">
            <h2>Natural Waist</h2>
            <p>Tie a string around your child's middle and have her bend from side to side. The string will settle
                around
                her natural waist, above her hipbones. Wrap a measuring tape around this part of her waist.</p>
