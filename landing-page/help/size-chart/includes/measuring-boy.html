            <h2>Chest</h2>
            <p>Wrap a measuring tape under your child's armpits, making sure it passes across the fullest part of his
                chest and around his shoulder blades. His arms should be relaxed naturally against his sides.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hips">
            <h2>Hips</h2>
            <p>Have your child stand with his legs together, not spread apart. Wrap the measuring tape in a loop around
                the widest part of his hips.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="waist">
            <h2>Natural Waist</h2>
            <p>Tie a string around your child's middle and have him bend from side to side. The string will settle
                around his natural waist, above his hipbones. Wrap a measuring tape around this part of his waist.</p>
