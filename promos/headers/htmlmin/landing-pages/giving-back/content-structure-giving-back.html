    <h2>Tea Gives Back</h2>
    <p>
      Tea gives back 10% of profits to <a href="https://globalfundforchildren.org/" target="_blank">Global Fund for Children</a> (GFC) and other groups that support the dignity of children everywhere. We’ve partnered with GFC to support two incredible Brazilian organizations—<a href="https://coresdoamanha.com.br/" target="_blank">Cores do Amanhã</a> and <a href="https://pazear.org.br/" target="_blank">Pazear Association</a>—empowering women and children through arts, sports, and education. This March, every donation you make to GFC will be matched by Tea, up to $5,000. Learn more about these organizations and our give back initiatives on our <a href="https://blog.teacollection.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>. Add your donation to cart and double your impact today!
