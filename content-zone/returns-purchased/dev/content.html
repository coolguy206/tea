  <ol>
    <li>Select the items you would like to send back to us, and specify whether you would like to return or exchange. If you select "exchange," you will receive a free shipping code in your confirmation email to place your replacement order at
      teacollection.com.</li>
    <li>At the bottom of the page, select your preferred Return Method. You may either return the items on your own by selecting the option to "Use the mail carrier of your choice", or we can email you a pre-paid label.<br>To get the label,
      please select "Use our pre-paid SmartLabel option for a $7 flat-rate fee to be deducted from your refund."</li>
    <li>Review your return and once you've verified that you have selected all the items you wish to send back, click the "CONFIRM ITEMS TO RETURN" button.
      <ul>
        <li>What happens next?</li>
        <li>You'll receive a return confirmation email. If you selected "exchange," we'll include a free shipping code to help you to place your new order.</li>
        <li>You'll also receive an email with the packing slip to send back with your return.</li>
        <li>If you chose that option, you'll receive an email with your SmartLabel to ship your package back to us.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once you receive your packing list email, print it out and enclose it in your return package. If you haven't received the packing list via email, you can print it from the Recent Product Returns page under the My Account section on our
      site.</li>
    <li>Mail the items back to us.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If you selected "Ship on your own" you can use any mail carrier you like. We highly recommend <u>using a tracking method</u> so that you will be protected if your order gets lost on its way to us. Please send your package to:</p>
